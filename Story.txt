Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey on a berry tree near the banks of a river. In the same forest, lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under a tree. The monkey offered the crocodile some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day. As days passed, they both became good friends.
